# Intro to Bitcoin for Banking Leaders
## AOBA Conference Talking Points
**Andrew Begin | CSO, Galoy | Feb 3, 2025**

---

## OPENING: The Hook (Slides 1-14)
*Target: ~5 minutes*

### The Symbol of the Beginning (Slide 3)
- **Image:** Intel 4004 microprocessor
- This is where it started. 1971. The first commercial microprocessor.
- Let the image sit for a beat — they'll wonder where you're going

### The Quote (Slide 4)
- **Beat:** "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." — Ken Olsen, 1977, founder of DEC
- Pause. Let it land.
- **Pivot:** How many computers are in your home now?
- Olsen claims this was taken out of context — he meant nobody would want a computer *controlling* their home
- **Punchline:** Even *that* has come true. Average American household: 20 connected devices
  - Phones, laptops, smart TVs, thermostats, doorbells, lighting, bikes, watches...
- **Landing:** Disruptive technology is hard to recognize in its early stages

### Optional Side Notes (use if time/energy allows)
- *Survivorship bias caveat:* "Quotes like this are susceptible to survivorship bias — we remember the ones that aged poorly"
- *Other early skeptics:*
  - Telephone "What use could this company make of an electrical toy?" William Orton, President of Western Union, 1876, on the telephone 
  - Automobile "The horse is here to stay, the automobile is only a novelty" president of a bank, advising against investing Ford (Horace Rackham)

### Chancellor on the Brink (Slide 5)
- **Image:** The Times newspaper headline — "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
- This headline was embedded in the first Bitcoin block by Satoshi Nakamoto
- A timestamp and a statement of purpose

### The Genesis Block (Slide 6)
- **Image:** Screenshot of the actual code containing "Chancellor on brink"
- Similar quotes existed about Bitcoin...

### Satoshi's Whitepaper (Slide 7)
- "...an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party."
- Satoshi Nakamoto, 2008

### The Skeptics Parade (Slides 8-9)
- 2011: The Economist — "clever notion... likely amount to little more than a curiosity"
- 2013: Greenspan — "You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven't been able to do it."

### How Innovation Works (Slide 10)
- **Image:** "How Innovation Works" book cover
- **Personal hook:** "Second daughter, poor sleeper. Night after night, hand cramped in crib, listening to audiobooks..."
- One of the books I dove into...

### Bitcoin's Prehistory (Slide 11)
- **Image:** Dan Held's chart of Bitcoin's prehistory
- The ideas that led to Bitcoin — decades of cryptographic and monetary thinking

### Personal Realization (Slides 12-14)
- **The two-part realization:**
  1. Our financial system is built for a world that requires intermediaries
  2. We no longer live in that world
- With Bitcoin: one person can send value to another, zero counterparties
- Anyone with an internet connection — even a 2G cellular network. Potential userbase of billions.

---

## SECTION 1: Digital Transformation of Money (Slides 15-35)
*Target: ~10 minutes*

### Three Monetary Epochs (Slides 15-17)
- **Setup:** If Bitcoin is an asset that any person in the world can access, it introduces a new era in money.
- **3000 BC:** Asset-based physical money (gold, shells, beads)
- **1600 CE:** Debt-based ledger money (banks, promissory notes)
- **2009 CE:** Asset-based ledger money (Bitcoin)
- **Key insight:** We've gone from physical assets → debt-based ledgers → back to asset-based, but digital
- **Lead out:** Where does that line go over the next 20 years? What does the global financial system look like if it continues up the technology adoption curve?
- I remember getting stuck on these questions late one night, trying to get my daughter back to sleep.

### The Tweet (Slide 18)
- When I got back to my computer, this tweet was on my screen...
- **"The moment you understand Bitcoin you will have a panic attack"**
  - Hyperbolic? Maybe. But you can't replace "Bitcoin" with just any word
  - ACH doesn't apply. Stablecoins might not. But AI does. The printing press. Steam engine.

### 1000 Years of Disruption (Slides 19-24)
- **Setup:** I'm not the only one tracking the transformative potential of Bitcoin.
- Bank of America Research put out a graphic called "1000 Years of Technological Disruption"
- What's on it?
  - Printing press
  - Steam engine
  - Microprocessor
  - World Wide Web
  - Bitcoin

### What Is So Disruptive About Bitcoin? (Slide 25)
- **Image:** SETI photo (searching for signals)
- Transition slide — pause, let them wonder
- You've heard the hype. You've heard the skeptics. So what *is* it about Bitcoin?

### Pools and Flows (Slide 26)
- **The Citibank exec story:** A friend of mine joined Citibank decades ago. An exec slapped him on the shoulder and said:
- "Banking is simple. It's just pools and flows."
- Money at rest, money in motion. I like that.

### Bitcoin = Asset + Network (Slide 27)
- I'd like to use that same framework to describe Bitcoin.
- **Bitcoin is simple too:** It's just an asset and a network.
- That's it. An asset you can hold. A network you can move it on.

### The Properties (Slide 28)
- But the *properties* of that asset and network make it incredibly disruptive:
  - **Scarce** asset
  - **Decentralized** network
- Let's unpack each.

### Scarcity (Slide 29)
- **Image:** Bitcoin supply and inflation rate chart over time
- How do we know it's scarce? **Five lines of code.**
- You can look it up on GitHub right now — it's open source
- Final supply: 21 million. Period.
- Every 4 years, the amount of new Bitcoin created is cut in half — until we hit 21 million
- Current inflation rate is already lower than gold
- "But didn't Jamie Dimon say Satoshi's gonna pop out of a box and double the supply or erase Bitcoin?"
- How do we know that won't happen? That's where decentralization comes in.

### Decentralization — The China Ban (Slide 30)
- **Image:** Hash rate chart with 2021 China ban news screenshot — shows the dip
- Quick story about how I learned how decentralized Bitcoin really is.
- I woke up to this headline in 2021: "China's top regulators banned crypto trading and mining"
- At the time, 50% of the computing power securing the Bitcoin network was located in China
- People were unplugging miners, putting them on boats and planes, getting them out of the country
- Look at that dip — 50% reduction in security
- The network was vulnerable
- **"Is this it? Is this where Bitcoin dies?"** — I remember thinking that.

### Decentralization — The Recovery (Slide 31)
- **Image:** Same chart, extended — hash rate recovered and grown 7x
- **Punchline:** In preparing for this talk, my mind was blown yet again.
- What's happened since? The hash rate has increased **7-fold.**
- A global superpower banned this open monetary technology... and it only got stronger.
- 7 times stronger.
- **Optional current event (if you see a dip on the chart):** You might notice the hash rate is down ~30% right now. That's Winter Storm Fernan — Bitcoin miners in Texas are voluntarily powering down to support grid balancing. They get paid to curtail during peak demand, then spin back up. The network keeps running, blocks keep settling. That's decentralization *and* grid flexibility working together.
- **"That's crazy to me."**
- Thinking about the implications of this technology gives me a bit of a physical reaction.
- A global superpower banned this technology... and it only got stronger
- **Phrase to land:** "That's crazy to me."

### Three Epochs Again (Slide 32)
- Callback to the framework — reinforces the point

### Fidelity's Take — The Full Chart (Slide 33)
- **Image:** Fidelity's "Bitcoin First" report graphic comparing gold vs bitcoin vs fiat — full chart
- This is from Fidelity's "Bitcoin First: Revisited" report, 2023
- They compared three monetary goods across key properties: gold, bitcoin, fiat
- "Bitcoin's value is driven by its enforceable scarcity"
- Not just a scarce asset. *Enforceable* scarcity. Via decentralization.

### Fidelity — First Three Properties (Slide 34)
- **Durable:** Bitcoin exists as information — it doesn't rust, rot, or degrade. As long as the network exists, your bitcoin exists.
- **Divisible:** Each bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places (100 million satoshis). You can send a fraction of a cent.
- **Fungible:** One bitcoin is interchangeable with any other bitcoin. No serial numbers, no "tainted" coins at the protocol level.

### Fidelity — Next Four Properties (Slide 35)
- **Portable:** Move $1 billion across borders in minutes for a few dollars in fees. Try that with gold.
- **Verifiable:** Anyone can run a node and verify the entire transaction history. No trust required.
- **Scarce:** 21 million. Period. We just covered this.
- **Track record:** 16 years, zero successful hacks of the protocol. 99.98% uptime. More reliable than most banking systems.

## SECTION 2: Opportunity for Banks (Slides 36-64)
*Target: ~12 minutes*

### Three Cohorts of Adoption (Slides 36-46)

#### The Unbanked (Slide 37)
- **Image:** Second grader in Jericoacoara, Brazil paying with tap-to-pay Bitcoin card
- Open source money, open source software
- Tap to pay. Ten sats — fraction of a cent.

#### Grassroots Growth (Slide 38)
- **Image:** Graphic showing massive growth of Bitcoin circular economies and grassroots initiatives
- **Global:** Ghana, Costa Rica, Peru, El Salvador, South Africa, Uganda
- But also: Germany, Italy, Netherlands
- Financial inclusion technology — but not *just* for the unbanked

#### The Banked (Slides 39-40)
- **Image:** Tad Smith — former CEO of Sotheby's, NYU Stern finance professor
- "At 58, I realized: money printer at 8-10%, S&P at 9.6%... I'm treading water"
- "You can put all your money in the S&P and you're not gaining any relative wealth at all. That's a startling insight."
- **The powerful story isn't about Tad Smith. It's that there are millions of Tads.**
- Opening 401k statements: "Why is this one index fund outperforming?"
- Bitcoin ETF, Strategy stock (MicroStrategy)
- Trillions of dollars looking for ways to save and store wealth

#### The Banks — Larry Fink (Slides 41-43)
- **Image:** Larry Fink
- 8 years ago — "Bitcoin is uninvestable"
- 2 years ago: Launched an ETF
- **Quote:** "BlackRock's US-based Bitcoin ETP was the largest exchange-traded product launch in history"
- **Quote:** "If the U.S. doesn't get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin."
- Larry Fink went from Bitcoin skeptic to Bitcoin's chief growth officer in 8 years

#### Institutional Demand (Slide 44)
- **Image:** Demand vs supply chart
- Institutional demand for Bitcoin is outpacing new supply by **7.4x**

#### Anthony Noto (Slide 45)
- **Image:** Anthony Noto, CEO SoFi
- "I heard many people that were naysayers about bitcoin saying many of the things I heard from naysayers about the internet back in 1999-2000."
- And he's acting on it:
  - SoFi offers Bitcoin buy/sell to customers
  - Partnered with **Lightspark** for international remittances over the **Bitcoin Lightning Network**
  - One of the **first US banks** to offer blockchain-powered remittances
  - How it works: USD → Bitcoin (Lightning) → local currency — delivered to recipient's bank account
  - Targeting the **$740 billion remittance market**
  - Launching in Mexico first, more countries to follow
  - Lower fees, faster delivery, 24/7 availability
- This is a Nasdaq-listed bank using Bitcoin rails for real payments. Today.

#### Abigail Johnson (Slide 46)
- **Image:** Abigail Johnson, CEO Fidelity
- That quote is from her recalling a moment in **2013**.
- "This looks real, this is something going on here. It could lead to radical changes in our business. And wouldn't that be interesting and exciting."
- They looked into **92 use cases**.
- Ended up doing Bitcoin mining and a Bitcoin giving/donation product.
- The Bitcoin mining project became one of their **highest ROI projects ever**.
- In **2015**, they experimented with Bitcoin payments in the corporate cafeteria — before Layer 2 Lightning even existed.
- Today? Fidelity manages the **2nd largest Bitcoin ETF** in the US.
- That's a 10+ year journey from curiosity to market leader.

### It's Still Early (Slide 47)
- **Image:** Chart showing top banks with Bitcoin projects in process — most are "announced" not active
- 14 of top 25 US banks reportedly have or are building Bitcoin products

### 2025 Regulatory Updates (Slide 48)
- **Image:** Regulatory timeline from 2025 — huge 180 in regulation
- **Quote:** "In my 34 years across multinational banks, leading fintechs, and leading consultancy, I've never seen regulatory clarity arrive this fast." — Robert Mancini, SRA Consultants
- **Timeline of recent changes:**
  - Jan 23: SEC rescinds SAB-121
  - Mar 28: FDIC rescinds FIL-16-2022
  - Apr 24: Fed revises guidance
  - May 7: OCC clarifies custody & execution
  - Jul 14: Interagency statement on risk management
  - Nov 18: OCC clarifies custody & execution (again)
  - Dec 8: CFTC launches Digital Assets Pilot
- **Message:** Regulatory clarity is arriving — this is a massive shift

### Six Opportunities for Banks (Slides 49-61)

#### 1. Education & Guidance (Slides 51-53)
- 14% of US adults own crypto
- 35% "know something about crypto"
- **This happened largely outside their banking relationship**
- 40% of males aged 31-35 own Bitcoin
- Opportunity: Be the trusted guide

#### 2. Custody & Safekeeping (Slide 54)
- "Bitcoin and banks: brethren?"
- Banks have been in the custody business for centuries. This is familiar territory.
- Three models — pick what fits your risk appetite:
  - **Custodian integration:** Partner with a qualified custodian (Anchorage, BitGo, Coinbase Prime). You provide the customer relationship, they handle the keys. Fastest path to market. **But:** You're giving up margin. And here's the strategic risk — these custodians are getting banking licenses. Anchorage has one. Others are applying. Today they're your partner. Tomorrow they might be your competitor. And you just handed them your customer list.
  - **Self-custody support:** Help customers hold their own keys. Think safe deposit boxes for the digital age. You provide education, tools, maybe recovery services. Lower liability, but you're still adding value and keeping the relationship.
  - **Bank-managed custody:** You hold the keys. Full control, full responsibility. Higher regulatory bar, but highest margin and deepest customer relationship. This is where the long-term defensibility is.
- The question isn't *whether* to offer custody — it's *which model* fits your institution.
- Banks are uniquely positioned here: trust, compliance infrastructure, existing customer relationships.

#### 3. BTC/USD Exchange (Slide 55)
- Enable customers to buy and sell Bitcoin without leaving the trusted environment of the bank.
- **The fee income story:**
  - This is non-interest income. Pure fee revenue. Doesn't touch your NIM.
  - Transaction fees: 1-2% spread on buy/sell is market standard. Coinbase charges more.
  - Recurring buys: Customer sets up $100/week auto-buy. That's recurring fee income with zero marginal acquisition cost.
  - No credit risk. No capital allocation. No loan loss reserves. Just fees.
  - Compare that to the work you do to earn a similar margin on a loan.
- **The retention story:**
  - Your customers are already buying Bitcoin somewhere — Coinbase, Cash App, Robinhood.
  - Every time they do, that's a touchpoint with a competitor. A login. A notification. A relationship.
  - When a customer opens a Coinbase account, they're not just buying Bitcoin — they're building a new financial relationship. That's the first crack in the wall.
- **The soft-switching problem:**
  - Today it's Bitcoin. Tomorrow it's "I can send money to my kid instantly on Cash App."
  - Then it's "Why do I even need my bank?"
  - The fintechs know this. That's why they offer Bitcoin. It's a wedge product.
- The banks that offer this keep the customer in their ecosystem. The banks that don't are sending customers out the door — and handing them to competitors who will cross-sell them everything else.

#### 4. Payments (Slides 56-57)
- On-chain Bitcoin payments (like Fedwire)
- Layer 2 Lightning Network (real-time payments)
- Digital Bitcoin wallet (eBanking, mobile)
- **Square:** 4M US merchants can accept BTC via Lightning (Nov '25)
- **SoFi & Lightspark:** Remittance payments over Lightning: USD → BTC → MXN
- **"YOU ARE HERE":** This is a Square merchant map. That pin? That's literally where we are right now. There are 90 merchants within an hour's drive of this conference that accept Bitcoin. The infrastructure is already being built around us.

#### 5. Asset-Backed Lending (Slides 58-59)
- **Win for banks:**
  - Overcollateralized (~50% LTV) with liquid, 24/7-priced collateral
  - Higher interest rates with lower credit risk
  - Continuous collateral monitoring
- **Win for customers:**
  - Access liquidity without selling long-term assets
  - Borrow from a regulated, trusted counterparty
  - Avoid opaque or untested counterparties

#### 6. Correspondent Banking (Slides 60-61)
- Operate Bitcoin banking infrastructure for other banks
- Institutional custody, exchange, settlement rails
- Extend distribution using existing compliance capabilities
- **The Chris Lane insight:** "Tokenized fiat is corresponding banking. Stablecoins are narrow banks. Bitcoin is central banking."

## CLOSING: The Call to Action (Slides 62-65)
*Target: ~3 minutes*

### Reframe the Epochs (Slide 62)
- Asset-based physical money → Debt-based ledger money → Asset-based ledger money
- We're at another inflection point

### Wrap-Up (Slide 63)
1. **Bitcoin is disruptive technology**
2. **Banks are uniquely positioned**
3. **The decision is how to engage**

### Next Steps (Slide 64)
1. **Answer:** "Is it real?" — Do your own research
2. **Analyze:** Use cases and business models for *your* institution
3. **Act:** Build, buy, or partner

### Final Thought
- "In a world that no longer requires intermediaries to send money, the role of banking changes."
- The leaders of the next 25 years will be those who built inroads to this parallel financial system
- Bitcoin is a network you can only opt into or opt out of

### Close (Slide 65)
- Thank you

## PHRASES TO LAND (Your Signature Moments)

Use these for emphasis — they work in your delivery:

- **"That's crazy to me."** — Use 2-3 times max, at genuine moments of insight
- **"Mind-blowing moment"** — When describing realizations
- **"Load of bricks"** — The weight of understanding
- **"Trillions of dollars looking for ways to save"** — The scale of opportunity
- **"Chief growth officer of Bitcoin"** — Larry Fink joke
- **"Space debris"** — If you use the solar system analogy
- **"Opt in or opt out"** — Bitcoin's permissionless nature

---

## AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC NOTES (Curious but Uninformed)

Since your audience is curious but uninformed banking leaders:

1. **Lead with credibility markers early** — BofA research, Fidelity, Larry Fink
2. **Don't assume technical knowledge** — "Five lines of code" is enough; don't go deeper
3. **Connect to their world** — Pools and flows, custody, correspondent banking
4. **Acknowledge their skepticism** — You were skeptical too (the skeptics parade)
5. **Make it practical** — Six concrete opportunities they can act on
6. **Leave them with a question** — "Is it real?" is something they can answer for themselves
