# DRAFT — The Final Digital Transformation

## The transformation of money and the systems that move it

Technology erodes inefficiency like water wearing down stone.

When an invention makes a once-difficult task easy enough, its worldwide adoption is inevitable. The process takes time, but eventually the new reduces the old to a novelty—like pay phones, fax machines, compact discs, and soon paper checks and credit cards.

As of this writing in 2026, most institutions in the world have undergone some form of “digital transformation.” Digital transformation takes many forms (I worked on many related initiatives throughout the 2010s), but for the purposes of this article, let’s define it as:

> **Digital transformation:** the process of updating systems to function and compete in a digital world.  In practice, it translates to **do more with less**.

At the core of any digital transformation is the need to increase the speed and efficiency of business operations in order to remain competitive. Whether it’s retiring paper forms for electronic ones, moving on-premise infrastructure to the cloud, or exchanging cashiers for self-checkout bays, each project replaces laborious processes with automatable and scalable ones.

We've been watching the S-curve of digital transformation unfold around the world for the last 20 years—but money, and the systems that move it, has been left behind.

## Money is still pre-internet

Money remains largely stuck in a pre-internet era. In many ways, we've rebuilt the offline financial system *online* over decades, preserving its structure rather than rethinking it.

As Abigail Johnson, CEO of Fidelity, recently observed at an a16z Founders Summit:

> "If you think about the world of tradfi right now, it's the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes, and it's really kind of scary. If you step back and look at it, nobody would ever build anything like that. It's just something that evolved organically, over decades..."

To be fair, internet-native money didn’t exist until 2009, when Bitcoin was introduced. And strict regulation has made the financial system especially resistant to change.

But the time has arrived.

Whether this transformation looks like a gradual, evolutionary digital transformation—or more like a creative-destruction event—remains to be seen. What *is* clear is that the global financial system is likely to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 100.

This article covers the forces reshaping money, banking, and the broader financial system, including:

- Bitcoin  
- Stablecoins  
- AI  
- Core banking systems  
- Regulation

## Force 1: Bitcoin’s steady march — a harder asset and a better network

> “Bitcoin changes absolutely everything.”  
> — Jack Dorsey, 2021

Bitcoin’s creation disrupted the banking system at the base layer. It introduced a way to transmit value globally in minutes, without a counterparty. It also created the world’s first asset with a finite supply and a predetermined issuance schedule.

The magnitude of this change is hard to overstate.

With Bitcoin—and layer-two networks built on top of it—eight billion people can now:

- Send and receive billions—or cents—instantly to anyone in the world  
- Self-custody a bearer asset that cannot be inflated  
- Accept payments at point of sale or online with ~10× lower fees than credit cards  
- Obtain dollar loans by posting bitcoin as collateral (asset-backed lending)  
- Distribute private keys across multiple stakeholders to manage risk  

Because Bitcoin and Lightning are open networks, these capabilities are accessible to anyone. A farmer in El Salvador and a president have the same rights on the Bitcoin network.

As adoption and development continue, the properties that make Bitcoin unique are being recognized—from the most marginalized communities to the world’s largest institutions.

### Why Bitcoin is "bulletproof" money

Banking, paper currency, and double-entry bookkeeping were created to facilitate commerce. Combined with the printing press and the telegraph, paper receipts made gold more divisible and portable.

For 17th-century merchants who would otherwise ship gold across oceans, these systems provided safety, reliability, and efficiency. Early banking emerged from institutions like temples, monasteries, and goldsmiths.

Those innovations evolved into today's global financial services industry, now generating more than **$30 trillion** in annual revenue. But the core logic remains largely unchanged: trusted intermediaries reconciling ledgers.

Bitcoin's innovation is simple: a shared ledger that doesn't need reconciliation. No intermediaries, no counterparties, no delays. Settlement is final.

Like brick-and-mortar retailers in the early 2000s, banks face a choice: adapt to the new infrastructure or cede ground to those who will.

Disruptive technology is hard to recognize in its early stages. But to grasp the magnitude of what's possible, consider Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and fiat money.

**The bottom line:** Bitcoin resolves the shortcomings of both fiat currencies and gold. As an open network with more than 15 years of continuous adoption, it is likely to continue gaining market share against both—especially as layers built on top of Bitcoin accelerate its use as a medium of exchange.

## Force 2: Stablecoins make dollars fly

The global financial system has been built in layers over centuries. Both the rules and the technology underpinning it are the result of additive changes.

The systems that facilitate money movement—whether between 17th-century merchants or modern gig workers—exist to ensure value can move from Person A to Person B without requiring face-to-face exchange.

The linchpin is **trust**.

Banks provide trust as a service. As economies globalize, more connectivity between banks is required—but banking technology is poorly suited for rapid evolution. Increased globalization also makes regulation more complex and costly.

The result is a fintech ecosystem of more than **20,000 companies**, each adding layers to make sending, saving, and investing money more accessible—but also adding counterparty risk.

While the internet enabled peer-to-peer communication, it did *not* enable peer-to-peer value transfer. In many cases, it increased the number of intermediaries required.

Bitcoin changed that.

As Satoshi Nakamoto famously wrote:

> “No mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.”

Until Bitcoin.

The fact that it can take six days—and multiple intermediaries—to send $50 from the Caribbean to Canada, with fees exceeding 10%, is indefensible in an internet-native world.

2025 has been widely described as **"the year of the stablecoin."**

### Why stablecoins matter for banks

Stablecoins—digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—solve a specific problem: they bring the speed and programmability of blockchain networks to familiar currency denominations.

For banks, this creates both threat and opportunity.

**The threat:** Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle now hold more U.S. Treasury securities than many countries. They're becoming systemically important financial institutions—without bank charters. Every dollar held in USDC or USDT is a dollar not held in a bank deposit account.

**The opportunity:** Banks can issue their own stablecoins, offer custody and on/off-ramp services, or integrate stablecoin rails into existing payment products. A bank that can settle cross-border payments in minutes rather than days has a competitive advantage.

The stablecoin market exceeded **$200 billion** in 2025. Major payment networks are integrating stablecoin settlement. Proposed federal legislation would establish clear rules for issuance and reserves.

For banks, the question is no longer whether stablecoins will matter—it's whether they'll participate or be disintermediated.

## Force 3: AI favors the nimble

> "In times of great change, the beginner has the advantage."

AI dramatically increases the return on flexible, well-designed systems. Institutions built on modular, API-driven infrastructure can deploy AI to reduce costs and accelerate decision-making. Those trapped in rigid, legacy architectures cannot.

AI does not just reward scale—it rewards adaptability.

### The automation gap

Consider two banks processing the same loan application.

**Bank A** operates on a 40-year-old core with batch processing, siloed data, and custom COBOL integrations. Adding AI requires months of vendor negotiations, middleware development, and regulatory review. By the time a pilot launches, the model is outdated.

**Bank B** runs on a modern, API-first core. Customer data flows through standardized interfaces. Within weeks, AI agents are triaging applications, flagging fraud patterns, and generating compliance documentation. The cost per loan drops by 60%.

This gap will only widen.

### Where AI hits hardest

The financial services tasks most vulnerable to AI disruption share common traits: they're repetitive, rule-based, and documentation-heavy.

- **Underwriting and credit decisions** — Pattern recognition across thousands of data points
- **Compliance and reporting** — Automated monitoring, flagging, and documentation
- **Customer service** — Natural language interfaces handling routine inquiries
- **Fraud detection** — Real-time anomaly detection at scale
- **Back-office reconciliation** — Matching transactions across systems

Banks that can plug AI into these workflows will operate at a fraction of the cost. Banks that can't will subsidize their inefficiency through higher fees—until customers leave.

### The talent problem

There's a second-order effect worth noting. The engineers capable of building AI-native financial systems are not choosing to work at banks with legacy infrastructure. They're joining fintechs, crypto companies, and tech firms where they can ship products in weeks, not years.

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: legacy systems repel modern talent, which slows modernization, which further entrenches legacy systems.

The banks that break this cycle will have an asymmetric advantage.

---

## Force 4: Regulation is a moving target

A loosening regulatory environment—including new bank charters for fintechs and increasing acceptance of bitcoin, digital assets, and stablecoins—is opening new markets and inviting new competition.

Regulation remains a constraint, but it is no longer a static one.

### The thaw

For years, U.S. regulators maintained what critics called "Operation Chokepoint 2.0"—an unofficial but coordinated effort to limit banking access for cryptocurrency companies. Banks that explored bitcoin custody or stablecoin services faced intense scrutiny.

That era appears to be ending.

In early 2025, the OCC issued guidance clarifying that national banks may custody digital assets and facilitate stablecoin transactions without prior approval. The FDIC walked back previous warnings. The SEC signaled a shift toward principles-based regulation for digital assets.

Meanwhile, the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework went into full effect, creating the first comprehensive regulatory regime for digital assets in a major economy.

The message to banks: the door is open.

### New charters, new competitors

Regulatory evolution isn't just about existing banks adding services—it's about who gets to be a bank at all.

Fintech companies that spent a decade avoiding bank charters are now pursuing them. SoFi obtained a national bank charter in 2022. Revolut has applied in the U.S. and U.K. Figure Technologies received conditional approval for a de novo national bank in 2024.

At the same time, stablecoin issuers are seeking state trust company licenses and bank charters to access Federal Reserve payment rails. Proposed federal stablecoin legislation would create new regulatory pathways.

The competitive landscape is being redrawn.

### The compliance advantage

Here's the counterintuitive opportunity: regulation can be a moat.

Banks already have compliance infrastructure, regulatory relationships, and risk management frameworks. A bank that adds bitcoin custody or stablecoin services to its existing platform can leverage that foundation.

A crypto-native startup building the same capabilities from scratch faces years of regulatory groundwork.

For banks willing to move, the window is open—but it won't stay open forever. As more institutions enter the space, early movers will establish the relationships, expertise, and customer trust that late entrants will struggle to replicate.

## Force 5: Legacy banking software is the choke point

Most industries have undergone digital transformation, upgrading to cloud-based and API-driven architectures. Banking has lagged behind.

In 2016, Forrester analyst Jost Hoppermann reported that **81% of banks** were undergoing or planning a major core transformation. Nearly a decade later, the road has been tumultuous.

Core conversions are so complex, risky, and expensive that **~75% of banks still operate on legacy platforms**.

### The oligopoly problem

The core banking market is dominated by three firms:
- FIS
- Jack Henry
- Fiserv

All were founded between the 1960s and 1980s. Each has attempted modernization, but transforming thousands of clients simultaneously is near-insurmountable.

Recent reactions to Fiserv's 2025 "modern core" announcement illustrate the skepticism:

> "Is this a real next-gen core, or another 'freeze the market' announcement?"
> "Are they building a Frankencore from zombie systems?"

The incentives don't favor innovation. These vendors profit from long-term contracts, professional services, and the switching costs that keep banks locked in. A truly modern core that customers could easily migrate away from would undermine their own business model.

Banks have survived by layering fintech on top of legacy cores—but this creates forward-compatibility problems.

### The fintech band-aid

Over the past decade, banks have addressed their technology gaps by partnering with fintech companies. Need mobile banking? Partner with a digital banking platform. Need faster payments? Integrate with a payment processor. Need fraud detection? Plug in a third-party solution.

This approach works—until it doesn't.

Each integration adds complexity. Data flows through multiple systems. Customer experiences become inconsistent. Compliance becomes fragmented. And when the next innovation arrives—whether it's real-time payments, bitcoin custody, or AI-driven services—the bank discovers its architecture can't accommodate it without another layer of middleware.

The result is what one industry observer called "a layer cake of technical debt, held together by prayers and professional services contracts."

### The path forward

Jost Hoppermann, now at The Angry Rabbit Group, argues banks must abandon one-time transformations and instead adopt continuously evolving architectures—unbundling from legacy systems while staying nimble as requirements change.

The most promising approaches share common elements:

- **Modular, API-first architecture** — Services can be added, replaced, or upgraded independently
- **Cloud-native infrastructure** — Elastic scaling, continuous deployment, reduced operational overhead
- **Open banking readiness** — Data and services accessible through standardized interfaces
- **Digital asset compatibility** — Native support for bitcoin, stablecoins, and tokenized assets

Some banks are building these capabilities internally. Others are partnering with next-generation core providers like Thought Machine, Temenos, and Mambu. A smaller number are exploring bitcoin-native banking infrastructure that treats digital assets as first-class citizens.

The warning signs are now flashing. Banks that continue deferring modernization may find themselves unable to catch up.

## The convergence

These five forces—bitcoin, stablecoins, AI, regulatory evolution, and legacy infrastructure decay—are not independent trends. They're mutually reinforcing.

Bitcoin and stablecoins create new rails for value transfer. AI makes it possible to build and operate financial services at radically lower cost. Regulatory shifts open the door for new entrants. And legacy infrastructure becomes the bottleneck that determines who can move fast enough to capitalize.

The banks that thrive in this environment will share certain characteristics:

- **Modern, modular infrastructure** that can integrate new capabilities quickly
- **Digital asset fluency** across custody, payments, and lending
- **AI-native operations** that reduce costs and improve decisions
- **Regulatory expertise** that turns compliance into competitive advantage
- **Customer trust** built over decades—now applied to new services

The banks that struggle will be those that treat digital assets as a regulatory risk to be avoided, AI as a future project, and core modernization as a problem for the next CEO.

## Conclusion: The final digital transformation

We began with a simple definition of digital transformation: *do more with less*.

For most industries, digital transformation meant upgrading systems to function in an internet-connected world. Retailers built e-commerce. Media companies launched streaming. Manufacturers adopted connected supply chains.

Banking is different.

The "final" digital transformation isn't just about upgrading systems—it's about the transformation of money itself. For the first time in history, we have internet-native money: scarce, programmable, and capable of moving globally without intermediaries.

This changes what a bank is, what a bank does, and who gets to be a bank.

As Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, put it:

> "60% of our members would like to have cryptocurrency offered from someone like SoFi that is a nationally licensed bank… Our bank license is now useful not just to take deposits that are insured and lend them, but to provide a very safe and reliable way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies."

The question facing every banking leader is not whether this transformation will happen—it's whether their institution will lead it, follow it, or be replaced by it.

The forces are in motion. The technology exists. The regulation is evolving. The customers are ready.

The only variable left is execution.
