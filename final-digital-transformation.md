# DRAFT — The Final Digital Transformation

## The transformation of money and the systems that move it

Technology erodes inefficiency like water wearing down stone.

When an invention makes a once-difficult task easy enough, its worldwide adoption is inevitable. The process takes time, but eventually the new reduces the old to a novelty—like pay phones, fax machines, compact discs, and soon paper checks and credit cards.

As of this writing in 2026, most institutions in the world have undergone some form of “digital transformation.” Digital transformation takes many forms (I worked on many related initiatives throughout the 2010s), but for the purposes of this article, let’s define it as:

> **Digital transformation:** the process of updating systems to function and compete in a digital world.  In practice, it translates to **do more with less**.

At the core of any digital transformation is the need to increase the speed and efficiency of business operations in order to remain competitive. Whether it’s retiring paper forms for electronic ones, moving on-premise infrastructure to the cloud, or exchanging cashiers for self-checkout bays, each project replaces laborious processes with automatable and scalable ones.

We've been watching the S-curve of digital transformation unfold around the world for the last 20 years—but money, and the systems that move it, has been left behind.

## Money is still pre-internet

Money remains largely stuck in a pre-internet era. In many ways, we've rebuilt the offline financial system *online* over decades, preserving its structure rather than rethinking it.

As Abigail Johnson, CEO of Fidelity, recently observed at an a16z Founders Summit:

> "If you think about the world of tradfi right now, it's the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes, and it's really kind of scary. If you step back and look at it, nobody would ever build anything like that. It's just something that evolved organically, over decades..."

To be fair, internet-native money didn’t exist until 2009, when Bitcoin was introduced. And strict regulation has made the financial system especially resistant to change.

But the time has arrived.

Whether this transformation looks like a gradual, evolutionary digital transformation—or more like a creative-destruction event—remains to be seen. What *is* clear (IMHO) is that the global financial system is likely to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 100.

This article covers the forces reshaping money, banking, and the broader financial system, including:

- Bitcoin
- Stablecoins
- Regulation
- Legacy infrastructure
- AI

## Force 1: Bitcoin’s steady march 

> "Bitcoin changes absolutely everything."
> — Jack Dorsey

Bitcoin’s creation disrupted the banking system at the base layer. It introduced a way to transmit value globally in minutes, without a counterparty. It also created the world’s first asset with a finite supply and a predetermined issuance schedule.

The magnitude of this change is hard to overstate.

With Bitcoin—and layer-two networks built on top of it—billions of people can now:

- Send and receive billions—or cents—instantly to anyone in the world  
- Self-custody a bearer asset that cannot be inflated by central bank policy  
- Accept payments at point of sale or online with ~10× lower fees than credit cards  
- Obtain dollar loans by posting bitcoin as collateral (asset-backed lending)  
- Distribute private keys across multiple stakeholders to manage risk  

Because Bitcoin and Lightning are open networks, these capabilities are accessible to anyone. A farmer in El Salvador and the president of a G7 nation have the same rights on the Bitcoin network.

As adoption and development continue, the properties that make Bitcoin unique are being recognized—from the most marginalized communities to the world’s largest institutions.

### Why Bitcoin is "bulletproof" money

Early banking emerged from institutions like temples, monasteries, and goldsmiths—trusted intermediaries who could hold and transfer value. Banking, paper currency, and double-entry bookkeeping were created to facilitate commerce. Combined with the printing press and the telegraph, paper receipts made gold more divisible and portable.

For 17th-century merchants who would otherwise ship gold across oceans, these systems provided safety, reliability, and efficiency.

Those innovations evolved into today's global financial services industry, now generating more than **$30 trillion** in annual revenue. But the core logic remains largely unchanged: trusted intermediaries reconciling ledgers.

Bitcoin's innovation is simple: a shared ledger that doesn't need reconciliation. No intermediaries, no counterparties, no delays. Settlement is final.

Like brick-and-mortar retailers in the early 2000s, banks face a choice: adapt to the new infrastructure or cede ground to those who will.

Disruptive technology is hard to recognize in its early stages. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin's total market cap is approximately 15% of gold's. But to grasp the magnitude of what's possible, consider Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and fiat money.

For a deeper look, see Fidelity's [Bitcoin First Revisited](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/bitcoin-first-revisited).

**The bottom line:** Bitcoin resolves the shortcomings of both fiat currencies and gold. As an open network with more than 15 years of continuous adoption, it is likely to continue gaining market share against both—especially as layers built on top of Bitcoin accelerate its use as a medium of exchange.

## Force 2: Stablecoins move dollars better

Stablecoins—digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—emerged to solve a practical problem: crypto traders needed a way to hold stable value without moving money back into bank accounts.

That use case exploded. Stablecoins became the default way to park value in the crypto ecosystem. Soon, other groups took notice. People in countries with failing currencies discovered they could hold dollars digitally, outside their local banking system. In Argentina, Turkey, Nigeria, and Venezuela, stablecoins became a lifeline—a way to preserve purchasing power when local currency couldn't.

The stablecoin market has surpassed **$300 billion**. Tether and Circle hold more U.S. Treasury securities than many countries. What started as crypto plumbing has become systemically important.

In parallel, banks are actively building and testing tokenized deposits—bringing existing bank liabilities onto programmable blockchain infrastructure. While stablecoins emerged from crypto, tokenized deposits start from the banking side. Both aim to make fiat move faster.

### The U.S. clears a path

In June 2025, the GENIUS Act was passed through Congress, providing a U.S. federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins: who can issue them, how reserves must be held, and which regulators are in charge. 

The benefit of a U.S. regulated stablecoin market is two-fold, from a policy perspective:
1. Faster, cheaper payments for U.S. individuals and businesses
2. Demand for U.S. Treasuries

While high speed and low cost are universally popular benefits, the U.S. appetite for stablecoins goes beyond simple technology-mindedness. Stablecoin issuers hold their reserves primarily in U.S. Treasuries—Tether alone holds more than most countries. A regulated stablecoin market means sustained demand for U.S. debt and continued dollar dominance in a world where money is increasingly digital.

The stakes are high. As Larry Fink wrote in his 2025 Chairman's Letter:

> "If the U.S. doesn't get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin."

Stablecoins offer policymakers a way to keep the dollar relevant as money goes digital.

For banks, one policy question hits closer to home: should stablecoins be allowed to pay yield?

That question is still under active scrutiny. If stablecoins can pay interest, they compete directly with deposit accounts. If they can't, they remain a payments tool rather than a savings product. The outcome will shape whether stablecoins complement banks or compete with them.

### The bigger picture

Stablecoins and tokenized assets bring the speed and programmability of blockchain networks to the money and financial products we all use on a daily basis. A bank that can settle cross-border payments in minutes rather than days – whether over stablecoin rails or the bitcoin network – has a real advantage. Now that regulatory headwinds are turning into tailwinds, the competition between payment rails of the future has truly begun.

## Force 3: Regulatory whiplash

> "In my 34 years across multinational banks, leading fintechs, and leading consultancy, I've never seen regulatory clarity arrive this fast."
> — Robert Mancini, SRA Consultants

For years, U.S. regulators maintained what critics called "Operation Chokepoint 2.0"—an unofficial but coordinated effort to limit banking access for cryptocurrency companies. Banks that explored bitcoin custody or stablecoin services faced intense scrutiny. Guidance across the board discouraged financial institutions from touching bitcoin and crypto. 

In May 2024, Congress passed a bipartisan resolution to overturn SEC guidance (SAB 121) that deterred banks from custodying crypto-assets. Notable Senators Schumer (NY), Gillibrand (NY), Wyden (OR), and Booker (NJ) voted to disapprove SAB 121; a clear defection from the anti-crypto camp. While President Biden later vetoed the resolution, the vote signaled a shift toward a more technology-forward approach to policymaking.

In 2025, U.S. regulators moved rapidly and in coordination, rescinding SAB 121, withdrawing prior banking guidance, clarifying custody and execution rules, passing the GENIUS Act, and ultimately launching a digital assets pilot. The timeline below highlights some key moments. (Full list at tools.galoy.io/regs) 

![Regulatory timeline for Bitcoin and crypto in 2025](https://github.com/agbegin/bitcoin-banking/blob/main/regulatory-timeline-bitcoin-2025.png?raw=true)

At the time of writing, the CLARITY Act (market structure bill) has passed the House and cleared the Senate Agriculture Committee—the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The debate over stablecoin yield under GENIUS continues. But as PwC's Matt Blumenthal signed off the foreword for this year's Global Crypto Regulation Report:

> "Regulation is no longer shaping crypto from the outside. It is being pulled into place by market reality."

![PwC Global Crypto Regulation Report 2026 quote](https://github.com/agbegin/bitcoin-banking/blob/main/pwc-crypto-regulation-report-2026.png?raw=true)

### A surge in bank charter approvals

The regulatory shift extends beyond crypto policy. In December 2025, the OCC conditionally approved five digital asset firms for national trust bank charters: Circle, Ripple, BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos. The OCC received 14 de novo charter applications in 2025 alone—nearly equal to the previous four years combined.

The applicants span industries. Fintechs like Mercury and Revolut are pursuing full bank charters. Defense-tech founder Palmer Luckey's Erebor Bank received conditional approval with backing from Founders Fund and 8VC. Even automakers have entered the fray, with GM Financial and Toyota Financial exploring banking licenses to support vehicle financing and payments.

The competitive landscape is being redrawn.

### The compliance reality

For new entrants—whether fintechs seeking bank charters or crypto-native companies building toward regulatory approval—the hill is steep. Compliance infrastructure, regulatory relationships, and risk management frameworks take years to build.

Banks already have that foundation. A bank that adds bitcoin custody or stablecoin services to its existing platform doesn't start from zero.

For banks willing to move, the window is open—but it won't stay open forever. As more institutions enter the space, early movers will establish the expertise and customer trust that late entrants will struggle to replicate.

## Force 4: The drag of legacy infrastructure

By now, most industries have rebuilt themselves from the ground up—internet-native, cloud-first, API-driven. Banking, largely, is still running on infrastructure designed before the internet existed.

In 2016, Forrester analyst Jost Hoppermann reported that **81% of banks** were undergoing or planning a major core transformation. A decade later, modernization has proven more difficult than expected. Core conversions are so complex, risky, and expensive that **~75% of banks still operate on legacy platforms**.

![Forrester 2016: 81% of banks undergoing or planning major core transformation](https://github.com/agbegin/bitcoin-banking/blob/main/forrester-2016-major-transformation-jost-hopperman.png?raw=true)

### The oligopoly problem

The core banking market is dominated by three firms. All were founded between the 1960s and 1980s. Each has attempted modernization, but transforming thousands of clients simultaneously is a herculean task. Progress has been so hard to come by that recent product announcements have been met with skepticism from the industry.

Consider the reactions to one major provider's 2025 "modern core" announcement:

> "Is this a real next-gen core, or another 'freeze the market' announcement?"

> "Are they building a Frankencore from zombie systems?"

It doesn't help that these vendors are as trapped as their clients. Decades of accumulated systems, processes, and integrations can't simply be ported to modern architectures—the lift is often comparable to building from scratch. That's opened a window for a new generation of cloud-native core providers unburdened by the past, built for a world of event sourcing, APIs, and AI from day one.

Banks have survived by layering fintech on top of legacy cores—but this creates forward-compatibility problems.

### The fintech band-aid

Over the past decade, banks have addressed their technology gaps by partnering with fintech companies. Need mobile banking? Partner with a digital banking platform. Need faster payments? Integrate with a payment processor. Need fraud detection? Plug in a third-party solution.

This approach works—until it doesn't.

Each integration adds complexity. Data flows through multiple systems. Customer experiences become inconsistent. Compliance becomes fragmented. And when the next innovation arrives—whether it's real-time payments, bitcoin custody, or AI-driven services—the bank discovers its architecture can't accommodate it without another layer of middleware.

### The path forward

Jost Hoppermann, now at [The Angry Rabbit Group](https://www.angryrabbitgroup.com/), argues banks must abandon one-time transformations and instead adopt continuously evolving architectures—unbundling from legacy systems while staying nimble as requirements change.

Regardless of path or timeline, banks need infrastructure that's ready for what's coming. That means systems built on:

- **Event-sourced architecture** — Complete audit trails built in, not bolted on; every state change recorded as an immutable event
- **Event-driven, modular design** — Loosely coupled services that can evolve independently without system-wide rewrites
- **API-first interfaces** — GraphQL or REST APIs as contracts between systems, enabling integrations without middleware
- **Cloud-native infrastructure** — Containerized, scalable, deployable anywhere—on-premises or in the cloud
- **Digital asset native** — Bitcoin, stablecoins, and tokenized assets as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts

Banks that invest now will be better positioned for whatever comes next.

## Force 5: AI accelerates everything

The infrastructure gap described above has existed for years. What's changed is the accelerant: AI.

The research that led to today's AI has been underway for decades. But sometime around late 2025, something shifted.

Andrej Karpathy—one of the architects of modern AI, former head of AI at Tesla—described it this way:

> "This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks... LLM agent capabilities have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence and caused a phase shift."

Just this week, people around the world are watching in awe as a group of self-directed AI agents set up their own social networks, make bitcoin payments, and coordinate tasks without human intervention. To go deeper, ask your favorite LLM about the "moltbot" phenomenon unfolding in real time.

This is the "suddenly" part of "[gradually, then suddenly](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/gradually-then-suddenly/)." AI capabilities that seemed perpetually five years away are now here—and improving weekly.

For banks, this creates a stark divide. Institutions built on modular, API-driven infrastructure can deploy AI to reduce costs and accelerate decision-making. Those trapped in rigid, legacy architectures cannot.

AI does not just reward scale—it rewards adaptability.

### The automation gap

Consider two banks processing the same loan application.

**Bank A** operates on a 40-year-old core with batch processing, siloed data, and custom COBOL integrations. Adding AI requires months of vendor negotiations, middleware development, and regulatory review. By the time a pilot launches, the model is outdated.

**Bank B** runs on a modern, API-first core. Customer data flows through standardized interfaces. Within weeks, AI agents are triaging applications, flagging fraud patterns, and generating compliance documentation. The cost per loan drops dramatically.

This gap will only widen.

### Where AI hits hardest

The financial services tasks most vulnerable to AI disruption share common traits: they're repetitive, rule-based, and documentation-heavy.

- **Underwriting and credit decisions** — Pattern recognition across thousands of data points
- **Compliance and reporting** — Automated monitoring, flagging, and documentation
- **Customer service** — Natural language interfaces handling routine inquiries
- **Fraud detection** — Real-time anomaly detection at scale
- **Back-office reconciliation** — Matching transactions across systems

Banks that can plug AI into these workflows will operate at a fraction of the cost—creating real pressure on those still waiting to modernize.

### The talent problem

There's a second-order effect worth noting. Engineers who can build AI-native financial systems will gravitate toward fintechs, crypto companies, and tech firms—environments where they can ship products in weeks, not years. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: legacy systems repel modern talent, which slows modernization, which further entrenches legacy systems. Banks that break this cycle will be better positioned to compete.

---

## The convergence

These five forces—bitcoin, stablecoins, regulatory evolution, legacy infrastructure decay, and AI—are not independent trends. They're mutually reinforcing.

Bitcoin and stablecoins create new rails for value transfer. Regulatory shifts open the door for new entrants. Legacy infrastructure becomes the bottleneck that determines who can move fast enough to capitalize. And AI accelerates all of it—widening the gap between those who can adapt and those who cannot.

The banks that thrive in this environment will share certain characteristics:

- **Customer trust** built over decades—now applied to new services
- **Operational readiness** to respond as regulations take shape and markets develop
- **Digital asset fluency** across custody, payments, and lending
- **Modern infrastructure** that can integrate new capabilities quickly
- **AI fluency** to reduce costs and improve decisions

## Conclusion: The final digital transformation

We began with a simple definition of digital transformation: *do more with less*.

For most industries, digital transformation meant upgrading systems to function in an internet-connected world. Retailers built e-commerce. Media companies launched streaming. Manufacturers adopted connected supply chains.

Banking is different.

The "final" digital transformation isn't just about upgrading systems—it's about the transformation of money itself. For the first time in history, we have internet-native money: scarce, programmable, and capable of moving globally without intermediaries.

This changes what a bank is, what a bank does, and who gets to be a bank.

The demand is already here. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto noted that 60% of their members want cryptocurrency services from a nationally licensed bank—a signal that customers are ready for institutions they trust to offer digital assets.

The question facing every banking leader is not whether this transformation will happen—it's whether their institution will lead it, follow it, or be replaced by it.

The forces are in motion. The technology exists. The regulation is evolving. The customers are ready.

The only variable left is execution.
