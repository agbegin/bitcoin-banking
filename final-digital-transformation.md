# DRAFT — The Final Digital Transformation

## The transformation of money and the systems that move it

Technology erodes inefficiency like water wearing down stone.

When an invention makes a once-difficult task easy enough, its worldwide adoption is inevitable. The process takes time, but eventually the new reduces the old to a novelty—like pay phones, fax machines, compact discs, and soon paper checks and credit cards.

As of this writing in 2025, most institutions in the world have undergone some form of “digital transformation.” Digital transformation takes many forms (I worked on many related initiatives throughout the 2010s), but for the purposes of this article, let’s define it as:

> **Digital transformation:** the process of updating systems to function and compete in a digital world.  
> Or more simply: **do more with less**.

At the core of any digital transformation is the need to increase the speed and efficiency of business operations in order to remain competitive. Whether it’s retiring paper forms for electronic ones, moving on-premise infrastructure to the cloud, or exchanging cashiers for self-checkout bays, each project replaces laborious processes with automatable and scalable ones.

We’ve been watching the S-curve of digital transformation unfold around the world for the last 20 years—but there is still one major institution remaining.

## Money is still pre-internet

Money—and the network of systems that move it—remains largely stuck in a pre-internet era. In many ways, we’ve rebuilt the offline financial system *online* over decades, preserving its structure rather than rethinking it.

As Rob Blackwell from the *Banking With Interest* podcast recently proclaimed:

> “No one would design the system that we have now.”

To be fair, internet-native money didn’t exist until 2009, when Bitcoin was introduced. And strict regulation has made the financial system especially resistant to change.

But the time has arrived.

Whether this transformation looks like a gradual, evolutionary digital transformation—or more like a creative-destruction event—remains to be seen. What *is* clear is that the global financial system is likely to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 100.

This article covers the forces reshaping money, banking, and the broader financial system, including:

- Bitcoin  
- Stablecoins  
- AI  
- Core banking systems  
- Regulation

## Force 1: Bitcoin’s steady march — a harder asset and a better network

> “Bitcoin changes absolutely everything.”  
> — Jack Dorsey, 2021

Bitcoin’s creation disrupted the banking system at the base layer. It introduced a way to transmit value globally in minutes, without a counterparty. It also created the world’s first asset with a finite supply and a predetermined issuance schedule.

The magnitude of this change is hard to overstate.

With Bitcoin—and layer-two networks built on top of it—eight billion people can now:

- Send and receive billions—or cents—instantly to anyone in the world  
- Self-custody a bearer asset that cannot be inflated  
- Accept payments at point of sale or online with ~10× lower fees than credit cards  
- Obtain dollar loans by posting bitcoin as collateral (asset-backed lending)  
- Distribute private keys across multiple stakeholders to manage risk  

Because Bitcoin and Lightning are open networks, these capabilities are accessible to anyone. The president of a country and a street vendor have the same rights on the Bitcoin network.

As adoption and development continue, the properties that make Bitcoin unique are being recognized—from the most marginalized communities to the world’s largest institutions.

## Why Bitcoin is “bulletproof” money

Banking, fiduciary media, and double-entry bookkeeping were created to facilitate commerce. Combined with the printing press and the telegraph, paper receipts made gold more divisible and portable.

For 17th-century merchants who would otherwise ship gold across oceans, these systems provided safety, reliability, and efficiency. Early banking emerged from institutions like temples, monasteries, and goldsmiths.

Fast forward to today, and the global financial services industry generates over **$30 trillion** in annual revenue.

Bitcoin synthesizes decades of advances in cryptography and computer science to create a decentralized monetary network. Because its innovation sits at the **settlement layer**, much of the banking software built to settle over SWIFT and Fedwire becomes technical debt if Bitcoin continues up the technology adoption curve.

Like brick-and-mortar retailers who watched internet-native companies outpace them in the 2000s, banks that opt out of Bitcoin may struggle to find a viable business model. Disintermediation is coming for global finance.

The conviction of Bitcoin proponents—ranging from Fidelity Digital Assets to Jack Dorsey—becomes clearer when Bitcoin is compared against its alternatives across the core properties of money.

These comparisons are explored in depth in:
- Fidelity’s *Bitcoin First*
- Vijay Boyapati’s *The Bullish Case for Bitcoin*

**TL;DR:** Bitcoin resolves the shortcomings of both fiat currencies and gold. As an open network with more than 15 years of continuous adoption, it is likely to continue gaining market share against both—especially as layers built on top of Bitcoin accelerate its use as a medium of exchange.

## Force 2: Stablecoins make dollars fly

> “No one would design the system that we have now.”  
> — Rob Blackwell, *Banking With Interest*

The global financial system has been built in layers over more than a century. Both the rules and the technology underpinning it are the result of additive changes.

The systems that facilitate money movement—whether between 17th-century merchants or modern gig workers—exist to ensure value can move from Person A to Person B without requiring face-to-face exchange.

The linchpin is **trust**.

Banks provide trust as a service. As economies globalize, more connectivity between banks is required—but banking technology is poorly suited for rapid evolution. Increased globalization also makes regulation more complex and costly.

The result is a fintech ecosystem of more than **20,000 companies**, each adding layers to make sending, saving, and investing money more accessible—but also adding counterparty risk.

While the internet enabled peer-to-peer communication, it did *not* enable peer-to-peer value transfer. In many cases, it increased the number of intermediaries required.

Bitcoin changed that.

As Satoshi Nakamoto famously wrote:

> “No mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.”

Until Bitcoin.

The fact that it can take six days—and multiple intermediaries—to send $50 from the Caribbean to Canada, with fees exceeding 10%, is indefensible in an internet-native world.

2025 has been widely described as **“the year of the stablecoin.”**

## Force 3: AI favors the nimble

> “In times of great change, the beginner has the advantage.”

AI dramatically increases the return on flexible, well-designed systems. Institutions built on modular, API-driven infrastructure can deploy AI to reduce costs and accelerate decision-making. Those trapped in rigid, legacy architectures cannot.

AI does not just reward scale—it rewards adaptability.

---

## Force 4: Regulation is a moving target

A loosening regulatory environment—including new bank charters for fintechs and increasing acceptance of bitcoin, digital assets, and stablecoins—is opening new markets and inviting new competition.

Regulation remains a constraint, but it is no longer a static one.

---

## Force 5: Legacy banking software is the choke point

Most industries have undergone digital transformation, upgrading to cloud-based and API-driven architectures. Banking has lagged behind.

In 2016, Forrester analyst Jost Hoppermann reported that **81% of banks** were undergoing or planning a major core transformation. Nearly a decade later, the road has been tumultuous.

Core conversions are so complex, risky, and expensive that **~75% of banks still operate on legacy platforms**.

The core banking market is dominated by three firms:
- FIS
- Jack Henry
- Fiserv  

All were founded between the 1960s and 1980s. Each has attempted modernization, but transforming thousands of clients simultaneously is near-insurmountable.

Recent reactions to Fiserv’s 2025 “modern core” announcement illustrate the skepticism:

> “Is this a real next-gen core, or another ‘freeze the market’ announcement?”  
> “Are they building a Frankencore from zombie systems?”

Banks have survived by layering fintech on top of legacy cores—but this creates forward-compatibility problems.

Jost Hoppermann, now at The Angry Rabbit Group, argues banks must abandon one-time transformations and instead adopt continuously evolving architectures—unbundling from legacy systems while staying nimble as requirements change.

The warning signs are now flashing.

## Conclusion: Adapt or be left behind

Three converging forces are set to disrupt banking as we know it:

- **AI**
- **Digital assets**
- **Regulatory shifts**

Banks that adapt can thrive. Those that don’t may not survive.

As Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, put it:

> “60% of our members would like to have cryptocurrency offered from someone like SoFi that is a nationally licensed bank… Our bank license is now useful not just to take deposits that are insured and lend them, but to provide a very safe and reliable way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.”
